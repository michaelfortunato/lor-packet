# What Is This?

I can imagine that writing a letter of recommendation is not fun, and on top of that _I know_ you have more important things to do. So I really can't thank you enough for taking the time and energy to write me a letter. 

In an attempt to make the process easier, I read on [Github][1] that you can help your professors by creating a letter of recommendation "packet".  It is supposed to serve as a one-stop-shop for letter writers about their subject. Here is mine. Hopefully it will be helpful.

Thank you, 

I am really grateful for you doing this.

Michael
