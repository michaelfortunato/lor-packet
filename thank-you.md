# Thank You

I just want to say thank you again. I think about the job you have--the on-going research, the mentoring of undergraduates and graduate students, the teaching obligations--and recognize how difficult it is to find the time to go out of your way to write this letter.  

I hope I have given you enough time and information to make the process easier. I really appreciate you doing this. Thank you.
